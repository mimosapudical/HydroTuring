# Building a HydroTuring sandbox

Instructions for a coding agent asked to make an existing hydrologic model
runnable under HydroTuring. A maintainer's agent evaluating a submission
end to end should start from `.claude/skills/hydroturing-evaluate-model/`,
which records the whole workflow and what the first evaluations taught. The work is always the same three files, and it
does not require understanding the model's internals.

Before any of it: contributions here start with an issue, not a pull request.
If there is no accepted [model proposal](https://github.com/Flood-Lab/HydroTuring/issues/new?template=model_submission.yml)
for this model, open one and wait for it to be labelled `accepted` and
assigned. Then fork, build, and open the pull request from the fork. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What you are building

```
models/<model-name>/
  model.yaml      declares what the model emits and needs
  Dockerfile      installs the model and the adapter
  ht_adapter.py   translates between the /io contract and the model's own API
```

## The contract

The harness exposes a small `/io` filesystem and runs your entrypoint once:

```
<entrypoint> --request /io/request.json
```

Paths inside `request.json` are relative to the request file's directory.

```
/io/request.json          read-only: opaque case id, model seed, timestep, n_steps, outputs
/io/input/forcing.csv     read-only: columns time, pr, tas, pet (mm/day, degC, mm/day),
                          and, when a probe prescribes a human withdrawal, abstr (mm/day, net);
                          when a probe prescribes an external hydraulic head, gwh (m);
                          a groundwater-exchange probe supplies gw_recharge (mm/day)
                          and sw_stage_m (m) instead
/io/input/static.json     read-only: catchment attributes
/io/output/result.csv     write: one row per forcing row, spinup included
/io/output/run.json       write: {"status": "ok"}
```

The model seed is deterministic for reproducible stochastic inference, but it
is not the generator seed recorded in the host-side report. Exit 0 on success.
There is no network. Do not attempt to download weights or data at run time;
bake them into the image.

Some probes prescribe a human withdrawal in the forcing as an `abstr` column
(mm/day, net of return flow). Honouring it means removing that water from the
stores and fluxes the model reports, and declaring whatever was actually
removed as a negative `gwex`. A model that never reads the column reports a
budget that closes on its own yet misses the withdrawal; the probe scores that
as a failure, not as INCOMPLETE, because such a model reports everything the
criterion needs.

One probe prescribes an external hydraulic head in the forcing as a `gwh`
column (metres). It is the head associated with the model's declared `gwex`,
which is positive into the catchment. Listing `gwh` in `needs_forcing` or
`uses_forcing` is a semantic opt-in, not a statement that the column was read:
the model is asserting that its external exchange responds monotonically to
this potential, as a general-head boundary does, and the probe holds it to that
by raising and lowering the head in paired runs from the first scored step on,
with the spinup identical across the runs. A model whose exchange is not
head-driven should not declare `gwh`; the probe requires the column, so such a
model is INCOMPATIBLE on it and its standing is untouched.

A groundwater-exchange probe instead supplies `gw_recharge` (mm/day, direct
recharge to the aquifer) and `sw_stage_m` (metres, the river stage the
aquifer exchanges with) in the forcing, and expects `gw_sw_exchange`, its
signed components `gw_to_sw`/`sw_to_gw`, and the `gw` state back.
`gw_sw_exchange` is not `gwex`: it moves water between two stores inside the
model's own control volume (`gw` and `channel`), not across the catchment
boundary, so it is never added to `gwex` or counted as a `closure` source. A
boundary term acting on the aquifer, such as a GHB or a well, is reported as
`gw_boundary`. Where that flow also crosses the catchment boundary it is
reported in `gwex` as well, and no budget adds the two. A
model with no groundwater-exchange term does not report the components, and
a missing output is checked before an unconsumed input, so it is
`N/A (INCOMPLETE)` on such a probe rather than scored.

## The evaluation window

A submitted model is not run over the full generated record. The harness
cuts the record down to the largest flood event, located by the probe's own
reference model, with the full spinup in front of it: by default 30 days for
a daily model and 7 days for an hourly one, so a heavy model fits the probe's
time budget. `n_steps` in `request.json` is the length the adapter must
emit, spinup included; it is 395 rows for a daily model on the default
window, not the 4015 of the full record. Ask for a different window, or the
whole record, in `model.yaml`:

```yaml
window_days: 30      # or any positive number of days, or "full"
```

A probe may set a minimum window when its expectation only holds over a
longer stretch; the warming-response probe asks for a year. Reference
models always see the full record, because the acceptance gate is defined
on it.

## The timestep

`request.json` names the step the case runs at, as an ISO 8601 duration:
`PT1D`, `PT1H`, `PT15M`, `PT5M` or `PT1M`. Fluxes are rates in mm per day at
every step, so the depth moved in one row is the rate times the step
length, and a one-millimetre burst in one minute arrives as 1440 mm/day.
`model.yaml` declares the step the model was built at, and may list others
it also runs at, native step first:

```yaml
timestep: PT1D             # or a list: [PT1H, PT1M]
```

A resolution probe serves the same weather at several steps and runs every
model at its own step and at the next finer one, whatever the manifest
lists. It then measures how far the integrated runoff moved, in percent of
the rain. A model whose arithmetic assumes its native step moves a lot.

**Put learned parameters in the units of the step.** A model whose network
writes physical parameters (a recession coefficient per day, a percolation
cap in mm per day, a unit hydrograph in days) has to have those parameters
rescaled to the step the case runs at before its physics uses them, or the
physics drains its stores as many times too fast as there are steps in a
day, and the probe measures the adapter's units rather than the model. A
per-day fraction k becomes 1 - (1 - k)^dt, a per-day amount becomes
amount × dt, a hydrograph keeps its shape in days. The networks themselves
are fed what they were trained on, rates in mm per day; the physics is fed
depths per row. `models/dhbv2/ht_adapter.py` does this.

**Feed the model the rows at the step you were given.** Do not aggregate
hourly rows to days inside the adapter, or split days into hours, to reach
the step the model prefers. The adapter is the model's units layer, not a
resampler: it turns rates into the depths the model wants for the step it
was handed, and resampling would hide exactly the dependence on the step
that the probe exists to measure. On a single-step probe the manifest's
step is respected: a daily closure probe given an hourly-only model reports
INCOMPATIBLE, because closure is what it measures and it cannot measure it
on a model it cannot feed.

## Nothing from the future

The stress probes add one storm to a record and check that nothing the
model reports changes before it. Any path from later rows to earlier
output fails that: a bidirectional pass, a centred filter, attention over
the whole record, or statistics taken over the record you were handed,
such as normalising inputs by their mean or deriving catchment attributes
from all of it. If the model needs a climatology, take it from the first
year of the record and nothing later. Paired variants of one seed carry
the same `seed` in the request, so a stochastic model draws the same
numbers in both runs; keep it that way and do not reseed from the clock.

## Variable names and units

| Name | Meaning | Units |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pr` | precipitation, echoed back from the forcing | mm/day |
| `evspsbl` | evapotranspiration | mm/day |
| `mrro` | total runoff | mm/day |
| `dis` | river discharge | m3/s |
| `gwex` | a declared exchange with the outside: regional groundwater, inter-basin transfer; positive into the catchment | mm/day |
| `gw_sw_exchange` | net river-aquifer exchange, positive into the aquifer; unlike `gwex`, this moves water between two stores inside the control volume (`gw` and `channel`), so it is never added to `gwex` or counted as a `closure` source | mm/day |
| `gw_to_sw` | groundwater-to-river exchange component: the aquifer losing to the river, so it is never positive; a component of `gw_sw_exchange`, not of `gwex`, and not an addition to it | mm/day |
| `sw_to_gw` | river-to-groundwater exchange component: the river losing to the aquifer, so it is never negative; `gw_to_sw + sw_to_gw` must equal `gw_sw_exchange` | mm/day |
| `gw_boundary` | every other flux across the aquifer's own boundary (a GHB or WEL package, regional groundwater exchange), positive into the aquifer. The part that also crosses the catchment boundary is reported in `gwex` as well, and no budget adds the two. A well that pumps aquifer water onto fields inside the catchment is `gw_boundary` but not `gwex`. `mass/gw-sw-exchange-consistency` credits this column to the aquifer, never `gwex`, because `gwex` may leave from any store | mm/day |
| `sbl` | the sublimating share of `evspsbl`: a component of it, never an addition; report it if the model knows which kilograms left as ice | mm/day |
| `snm` | liquid water delivered from the snow module to the ground, including rain passing through the snow module and snowmelt; an internal flux across the snow-module boundary, never an additional catchment outflow beside `mrro` | mm/day |
| `hfls` | latent heat flux, positive away from the surface | W/m2 |
| `hfss` | sensible heat flux, positive away from the surface | W/m2 |
| `hfg` | ground heat flux at the actual soil surface, positive into the ground; a flux taken below the surface must be corrected for heat storage above that depth | W/m2 |
| `rlus` | total upward longwave radiation at the surface: emission plus reflected downward longwave, positive away from the surface; row i's value is at row i's `time`, the same instant as row i's `rlds` | W/m2 |
| `hfg_bottom` | downward heat flux through the bottom of the specified soil layer | W/m2 |
| `tsoil_layer` | mean temperature of that soil layer at the end of the interval; a diagnostic, not a water store | K |
| `mrso` | soil water storage | mm |
| `snw` | snow water equivalent | mm |
| `canopy` | canopy interception storage | mm |
| `gw` | groundwater storage below the soil column | mm |
| `channel` | water generated as runoff but not yet released by the model's routing | mm |
| `ts` | surface (skin) temperature at row i's `time`, the same instant as row i's `rlds`; a diagnostic, declared under `emits.diagnostics`, neither integrated nor differenced by any budget | K |
| `stage` | water-surface elevation on the fixed vertical datum declared by the case; `bed_elevation_m` is the rigid reach bed on that same datum, so water depth is `stage - bed_elevation_m` at every step. Stage is a diagnostic, declared under `emits.diagnostics`, never a storage any budget is differenced over | m |
| `lwsnl` | **every non-solid component of `snw`** at the end of row i's step, so that `snw - lwsnl` is the ice and nothing else. Liquid held in the pore space, and any other non-solid water the model counts inside `snw`: for Snow-17 that is `LIQW` together with the lagged excess and storage terms, since `snw` there is `WE + LIQW + exlag + storge`. Part of `snw` and never additional to it; a diagnostic, declared under `emits.diagnostics`, and excluded from every water-storage sum because counting it beside `snw` would count the same kilogram twice | mm |
| `csnow` | the snowpack's **cold content** at the end of row i's step: the energy still needed to bring its ice to 0 °C, as a positive quantity, and zero for a ripe or empty pack. Reported as energy rather than as a temperature because that is what a budget spends, and because converting a temperature back through an assumed heat capacity is wrong for any model whose capacity differs; Snow-17 already carries it directly as `NEGHS`. A diagnostic, declared under `emits.diagnostics` | J m-2 |

For `hfg`, an adapter mapping a plate-depth or deeper-boundary flux must use
`G_surface = G_depth + (E_above_end - E_above_start) / dt`, with downward
fluxes positive, `E_above` in J/m2 and `dt` in seconds. The storage and fluxes
must cover the same area, layer and time interval; this relation assumes no
other energy sources or sinks in that layer. Use the model's actual heat
storage, not a value inferred from the surface-budget residual. Document the
mapping and any unavailable terms. Once `hfg` is mapped to the surface, do
not subtract subsurface heat storage again in the surface budget.

Declare temperature under `emits.diagnostics: [tsoil_layer]`, never under
`emits.states`. Probes request it through `requires.diagnostics`; it is
excluded from water-storage sums. For soil heat storage, both boundary fluxes
are interval means and the temperature is the mean over the same fixed layer
at the interval end. The row's `time` still matches the forcing interval's
start. Include spinup rows: the last spinup temperature is the first scored
interval's initial temperature. Use native model outputs with matching layer
boundaries and a declared heat capacity; do not reconstruct a boundary flux
from the same temperature change the probe checks.

A probe names the stores it requires. Report every store the model
actually has, including ones the probe did not name: a groundwater zone
under `gw`, water in transit through a unit hydrograph or a channel under
`channel`. The budget is closed over all of them. Leaving one out opens the
budget by exactly the water it holds, and a model with a groundwater store
that reports only soil water will be measured as leaking. A store the model
does not have at all is not fabricated to fill a column; say so in the
adapter's README and in `run.json`.

A model with an explicit exchange with the outside, a regional groundwater
term or an inter-basin transfer, reports it as the flux `gwex`, positive
into the catchment. Declared, it is a source in the budget and the budget
can close; hidden, it is the residual, and the closure probe reports the
model as leaking or making water by exactly that term. The runoff ratio is
taken against rain plus the declared source. `models/dhbv2` does this for
HBV 2.0's regional groundwater term.

## Three rules that are easy to get wrong

1. **States are absolute, never tendencies.** Report the storage itself at
   each step. The harness differences it. If you report `dS/dt` you have
   removed the quantity the benchmark checks, and the model will be scored as
   if it invented its storage.

2. **Echo `pr` exactly as given.** The harness compares your reported
   precipitation against the forcing it handed you. Rescaling it, even for
   unit reasons, fails `forcing_fidelity`.

3. **Emit one row per input row, spinup included.** Do not trim the spinup
   yourself. The harness knows where the window starts and slices it.

## Emit only what the model actually produces

Do not invent values to fill columns. A model that genuinely produces only
discharge should declare exactly that:

```yaml
emits:
  fluxes: [mrro, dis]
  states: []
```

Every probe that needs more than that will be `N/A` with reason
`INCOMPLETE`, which is the honest outcome: not a fail, but a probe that
cannot be put to the model, so it counts neither way. Fabricating an
`evspsbl` column to avoid `INCOMPLETE` produces `VIOLATION` instead, which
is worse and is also dishonest.

`needs_forcing` and `needs_static` declare inputs the adapter cannot run
without; a missing input makes the case `N/A (INCOMPATIBLE)`.
`uses_forcing` and `uses_static` declare optional inputs: the adapter must
consume them whenever supplied, but can run without them using a documented
fallback. The one carve-out is `gwh`, the prescribed external head, where the
declaration is a semantic opt-in rather than a promise about the column: a
model may read a head for another purpose, so declaring `gwh` asserts that the
model's own `gwex` responds monotonically to that head, and
`mass/exchange-response` holds it to the assertion rather than to the reading. A probe's `requires.forcing` and `requires.static` accept either
declaration. For example, `energy/radiation-consistency` requires consumption
of `rlds` and `eps`; a model that does not declare it consumes both is
`N/A (INCOMPATIBLE)` because it may be computing its own sky or emissivity.

Declare diagnostic outputs under the optional key `diagnostics`, such as
`[ts]`, `[tsoil_layer]` or `[stage]`. They are excluded from water-storage
sums. Each criterion defines their time handling: radiation reads
instantaneous `ts`, soil heat storage differences interval-end
`tsoil_layer`, and the rating probes read the reported `stage` alongside
the reach's discharge and store.

For soil heat storage, declare consumption of the prescribed layer depth,
areal heat capacity and initial temperature, as well as the incoming
radiation and air temperature. A model that cannot configure that control
volume is `N/A (INCOMPATIBLE)`, not a failed energy budget. The synthetic
reference represents a lumped layer from zero to the prescribed depth;
its areal capacity already includes depth. Document the actual parameter
and boundary mapping in `run.json`; metadata alone does not prove compliance.

## Verify before you submit

```bash
ht verify-adapter --model <model-name>   # contract only, no physics
ht run --model <model-name>              # the actual evaluation
```

`verify-adapter` runs a single seed, on the same window the evaluation will
use, and checks the shape of what came back. Get that green before looking
at any residual. Without `--probe` it checks the closure probe, or the first
probe the model can consume when it cannot consume that one: a step it does
not declare, a forcing or static input the probe does not generate, or a window that drops a
stretch the probe scores makes a probe N/A (INCOMPATIBLE) for the model.
When that is true of the probe named with `--probe`, or of every probe, the
adapter is not run and the command exits 1, as `ht run` does for a model no
probe could score. Exit 2 means the adapter broke the contract or the
harness failed. Both commands take `--csv models/result.csv` to append what
they found to the archive, and `--window DAYS|full` to override the
manifest.

## A minimal adapter

`models/reference_bucket/ht_adapter.py` is a complete worked example in the
standard library alone. Copy its structure. The model-specific part is the
`simulate` function; everything around it is contract plumbing that does not
change.

## When a probe or a model merges: what has to move with it

This section is for whoever lands the pull request, human or agent. The
harness discovers a probe from its directory and a model from its manifest,
but six other places describe the suite in prose and none of them are
generated. `tests/test_docs_in_sync.py` fails when any of them is behind,
and the probe workflow runs it on every pull request, so a merge that skips
this list is caught before it lands rather than noticed a week later.

For a merged probe:

1. `README.md`: a row in the probes table, and a row in the reference-models
   table for every reference model the probe adds. A model's standing counts
   its passes out of the probes that could score it. A probe it is N/A on,
   because it does not report a variable the probe needs or cannot consume
   it, changes neither number, so "PASS, N of N" stays as it is; if that is
   true of the physical models, only the sentence above the table that says
   what they must pass changes. A probe that can score a model adds one to its
   total, and one to its passes if the model passes it.
2. `CONTRIBUTORS.md`: a row in the probes table naming the author with
   their affiliation, as `Name (Institution)`. A merged probe earns
   co-authorship, so this row is the record of that. The affiliation comes
   from `authors` in the probe's `probe.yaml`; if it is missing there, ask
   the author before merging rather than after, because the test that
   checks it (`test_probe_authors_carry_an_affiliation`) fails the build.
3. `CITATION.cff`: an `authors` entry for every probe author not already
   listed, with `given-names`, `family-names`, `affiliation` and `orcid` as
   a full `https://orcid.org/` URL. This is the software's author list and
   the paper's starting point. Contact emails stay out of the repository;
   ask for one privately at merge time.
4. `ROADMAP.md`: the entry moves from unclaimed to `**merged**`, under the
   id the probe actually took, with the author named. Rewrite the paragraph
   above it if it counted the unclaimed entries.
4. `site/index.html`, three times, once per language block: the row in
   `probes.rows` moves from the wanted block to the merged block under its
   real id; an `N / M` in `models.rows` moves only for a model the new probe
   can score, because M counts the probes that could ask that model
   something and a probe it is N/A on is in neither number; the flowchart
   under "How it works" gains a labelled entry in the right pillar,
   with an `infra.probe.<key>` translation in each language, measured against
   the pillar's width. The badge count is generated and needs nothing.
5. `models/result.csv`: one row per evaluated model on the new probe, written
   by `ht run --model <name> --probe <id> --gate-seeds --csv models/result.csv`
   rather than by hand. A probe that cannot be put to the model is archived
   as `N/A` with its reason, like any other row.
6. This file, if the probe introduced a variable: a row in the table above.
   `spec.py` accepts the name the moment it is in `FLUX_VARS`; nothing tells
   an adapter author it exists except this table.

For a merged model: the README models table, the CONTRIBUTORS models table,
the site's `models.rows` in all three languages, and the archive rows from
`ht run` on every probe. The pages workflow redeploys the site on any push
that touches `site/`, `probes/` or `models/`.
