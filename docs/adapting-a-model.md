# Adapting a model

Walkthrough for wrapping an existing hydrologic model so HydroTuring can run
it. See `AGENTS.md` for the contract stated compactly, which is also what to
hand a coding agent.

## 0. Propose it first

Open a [model proposal](../../../issues/new?template=model_submission.yml)
before you build anything. It is where we find out whether the model can be
containerised at all, and who is going to do it. A maintainer labels the issue
`accepted` and assigns it; then fork, and work through the rest of this page.

**You do not need to be able to package the model to propose it.** The form's
*packaging status* field decides who the issue is assigned to and nothing else
— not whether it is accepted, and not your credit. Five accepted model
proposals count as one merged probe towards co-authorship on the benchmark
paper, whoever performs the packaging. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#credit).

## 1. Decide what your model honestly emits

This is the only decision that requires judgement. List the variables the
model genuinely produces. Do not pad the list.

A model that predicts only discharge declares:

```yaml
emits:
  fluxes: [mrro, dis]
  states: []
```

and is `N/A (INCOMPLETE)` on every probe that needs more than discharge: not
scored, so those probes count neither for it nor against it. That is the
correct outcome, and it is a different statement from `FAIL (VIOLATION)`.
Inventing an evapotranspiration column to escape `INCOMPLETE` converts an
honest limitation into a false claim, and the budget will not close anyway.

Outputs that are not a flux or a storage have an optional `diagnostics` group.
Most are not water at all -- a surface or layer temperature, a pack's cold
content -- but `lwsnl` is: it is the liquid share of `snw`, water already
counted inside that storage, so it is declared here precisely because it must
never be added to a water-storage sum beside `snw`. A model that reports
soil-layer temperature and its boundary heat fluxes can declare:

```yaml
emits:
  fluxes: [hfg, hfg_bottom]
  states: []
  diagnostics: [tsoil_layer]
```

`tsoil_layer` is the layer-mean temperature in kelvin at each interval's end;
it is never included in water-storage sums. `hfg` and `hfg_bottom` are the
interval-mean downward heat fluxes in W/m2 at the actual soil surface and at
the bottom of that same layer. The row timestamp remains the forcing
interval's start. Emit the temperature during spinup too, so the last spinup
row supplies the initial temperature of the first scored interval. Document
the layer bounds and heat capacity. Use the model's own fluxes, not fluxes
reconstructed from the temperature change being checked. Missing diagnostics
that the manifest does not declare give `N/A (INCOMPLETE)`. Declaring a
diagnostic but omitting it from the output is a protocol error. The separate
`ts` diagnostic is instantaneous surface temperature for radiative checks;
it cannot replace the interval-end mean-layer `tsoil_layer`.

The `stage` diagnostic is a water-surface elevation in metres on the fixed
vertical datum declared by the case. `bed_elevation_m` is the rigid reach bed
on that same datum, so water depth is `stage - bed_elevation_m` at every step.
Do not report depth above bed in the `stage` column, infer an undeclared datum,
or treat stage as a water-storage term.

For the soil-storage probe, the control volume extends from the surface to
`soil_layer_depth_m`, with prescribed `soil_heat_capacity_areal` and
`soil_temperature_initial`. Configure that layer before running the model.
The effective areal capacity already includes its thickness; it is not a
coefficient to fit from the output. A model unable to represent these
conditions is `N/A (INCOMPATIBLE)`, not a physics violation.

The probe's `requires.forcing` and `requires.static` must match inputs the
model declares in `needs_*` or `uses_*`. Declare only inputs the adapter
actually consumes, and document their mapping to native parameters. Layer
metadata makes that mapping auditable; a matching declaration alone does not
prove that the model used it. See the [soil-storage case](../probes/energy/soil-heat-storage-consistency/README.md).

Routing probes may supply `q_in`, a prescribed river inflow in m3/s, positive
into the routing control volume. This is already a volumetric discharge: do
not convert it through `area_km2` as though it were a depth rate. A model
listing `q_in` under `uses_forcing` must map it to a real native
river/reach-inflow path whenever the column is present.

## 2. Write the adapter

Read `/io/request.json`, read the forcing, call your model, write the table.
The plumbing is about thirty lines and does not depend on your model.

```python
request = json.loads(Path(sys.argv[-1]).read_text())
io_dir  = Path(sys.argv[-1]).parent
forcing = list(csv.DictReader(open(io_dir / request["input"]["forcing"])))
static  = json.loads((io_dir / request["input"]["static"]).read_text())

rows = my_model.run(forcing, static)          # <- the only model-specific line

with open(io_dir / request["output"]["table"], "w", newline="") as fh:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(fh, fieldnames=COLUMNS)
    writer.writeheader(); writer.writerows(rows)
```

`models/reference_bucket/ht_adapter.py` is the full worked version, standard
library only.

## 3. Write the Dockerfile

Install the model and everything it needs. There is no network at run time, so
weights, lookup tables and parameter files must be baked into the image.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir my-hydro-model==1.2.3
COPY ht_adapter.py /model/ht_adapter.py
WORKDIR /model
ENTRYPOINT []
```

The entrypoint stays empty; `model.yaml` supplies the argv.

## 4. Verify the contract before the physics

```bash
ht verify-adapter --model my-model
```

This invokes the adapter even when the model cannot emit enough variables for
the selected scientific probe. It asks for every output declared in
`model.yaml` and checks the row count, exact time axis, declared columns,
finite values and output-size limit. Get it green first. A residual computed
from a malformed table tells you nothing.

It runs on the closure probe, or on the first probe your model can consume
when it cannot consume that one: a model driven by net radiation is checked
on an energy probe, because the closure probe generates none. A probe the
model cannot consume, at its step, with its forcing or static inputs, or on its window, is N/A
(INCOMPATIBLE) for it. When that is true of the probe named with `--probe`,
or of every probe, the adapter is not run and the command exits 1, as
`ht run` does for a model no probe could score. Exit 0 is a contract that
holds, exit 2 an adapter or harness failure.

## The evaluation window

A submitted model is scored on a flood event, not on the full generated
record. The harness generates the whole record, asks the probe's reference
model where the largest flood of the requested length is, and hands the
submitted model that stretch with the full spinup in front of it. The
default is 30 days for a daily model and 7 days for an hourly one, which is
long enough to see the event and short enough that a model taking seconds
per forecast fits the probe's time budget. Every criterion is scored on the
window, and the report says which dates were scored for each seed.

The submission form asks whether you want a particular window. Whatever was
agreed goes in the manifest, and the command line can override it for a
one-off:

```yaml
window_days: 30        # any positive number of days, or "full"
```

```bash
ht run --model my-model --window 90
ht run --model my-model --window full
```

Two consequences for an adapter. `n_steps` in the request is the length to
emit, spinup included, and it is not the length of the full record. And a
model that needs a long history behind every prediction, as a sequence model
does, gets the probe's spinup for that purpose and nothing more: the first
rows of the record have less history behind them than the last, and the
adapter has to produce a finite value for them anyway.

Reference models always see the full record, because the acceptance gate is
defined on it. The one criterion that is climatological by construction, the
runoff ratio inside `non_degenerate`, is reported but not judged on a window
shorter than a year, since a melt flood returns more water than fell on it
that month and that is physics rather than degeneracy.

## Private evaluation suites

The probes committed to this repository are public development tests. They
generate fresh cases, so exact rows cannot be memorised, but their generating
distribution is intentionally reviewable and is not secret.

A trusted evaluator can add an uncommitted probe tree at run time:

```bash
ht validate --probe-root /secure/hidden-probes
ht run --model my-model --probe-root /secure/hidden-probes --json report.json
```

The external tree uses the same `probes/<law>/<id>/` layout. Its generator and
criteria execute only on the host. A submitted container receives read-only
forcing and static inputs, an opaque case identifier, a model-specific random
seed, and a writable output directory; it never receives the probe path,
generator seed, annotations, criterion names or tolerances. Freeze the model
image before running this private suite if the result is meant to demonstrate
generalisation beyond training.

## 5. Run it

```bash
ht run --model my-model --markdown
ht run --model my-model --json results/my-model/report.json
ht run --model my-model --gate-seeds --csv models/result.csv
```

`models/result.csv` is the archive of every evaluation: one dated row per
probe, plus one for the adapter contract check when `verify-adapter` is
given the same `--csv`. For a model that reports only discharge, the
contract row is the only line saying it was actually built and run on a
budget probe, because that probe is N/A (INCOMPLETE) before the container is
started. Where the criteria ran, a row's `detail` names the ones behind its
verdict with what each measured: those that failed, or on a pass those the
probe exists to score, such as `human_abstraction` rather than the closure
of the natural run.

## 6. Submit it

Push to your fork and open a pull request titled `[MODEL] <name>`, linking the
proposal issue so it closes on merge. Paste the `--markdown` report into the
template.

**A FAIL is not a reason to hold the pull request back, and nor is an N/A.**
`INCOMPLETE` is the current state of nearly every published rainfall-runoff
model on the budget probes, and recording that honestly is a large part of
what the benchmark is for. Review is on the contract — does the adapter
honour `/io`, is `emits` honest, is the image reproducible — never on the
verdict.

## Common failures

**"result has N rows, expected M"** — the spinup was trimmed. Emit one row per
input row; the harness slices the window itself.

**`forcing_fidelity` fails** — the reported `pr` does not match the input,
usually a unit conversion. Forcing is mm/day.

**`state_bounds` fails but `closure` passes** — the model is computing a
storage term as the budget residual. This is the pattern the benchmark exists
to detect, and it is worth checking whether it is deliberate.
