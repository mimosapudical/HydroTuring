# Contributors

Everyone who has shaped HydroTuring. Probe authors are also recorded in each
probe's `probe.yaml` and appear in every report that runs their probe.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#credit) for how credit and authorship
work here.

The counts on the repository page (probes merged, models evaluated) are
generated from `probes/` and `models/` by `scripts/badges.py` every time
the site deploys, so this file and those badges cannot drift apart for
long.

## Models

Proposed models, with who proposed them and who packaged them. These are
separate contributions and are recorded separately: deciding what belongs in
the benchmark is a different judgement from wrapping it in a container, and
five accepted proposals count as one probe towards authorship. Every
evaluation is archived in [models/result.csv](models/result.csv).

| Model | Proposed by | Packaged by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `google_flood_forecast` | Zhi Li (CU Boulder), [#1](../../issues/1) | HydroTuring maintainers |
| `dhbv2` | Zhi Li (CU Boulder), [#2](../../issues/2) | HydroTuring maintainers |
| `wflow_sbm` | Yuanhang Liu (Independent Researcher), [#29](../../issues/29) | HydroTuring maintainers |
| `summa` | Yuanhang Liu (Independent Researcher), [#30](../../issues/30) | HydroTuring maintainers |
| `cwatm` | Yuanhang Liu (Independent Researcher), [#28](../../issues/28) | HydroTuring maintainers |
| `lisflood` | Yuanhang Liu (Independent Researcher), [#20](../../issues/20) | HydroTuring maintainers |
| `modflow6` | Yaji Wang (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), [#25](../../issues/25) | Yaji Wang (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) |

Physical reference models, which every compatible probe must pass when their
outputs support its criteria:

## Scientific steering committee

Being formed. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). If you would be willing to
serve, or want to suggest someone, open an issue.

## Reviewers

Probe review is real work and is recorded here. Reviewers of merged probes
will be listed as they accumulate.
