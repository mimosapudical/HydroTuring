# fluxes are W m-2, positive away from the surface for the turbulent terms and
# positive into the ground at the actual soil surface for `hfg`. Adapters
# must correct a deeper-boundary flux for heat storage above that depth;
# subsurface storage is not also subtracted from the surface budget.
# `sbl` is a component of `evspsbl`, never an addition to it. `rlus` is the

    """Paired criteria and `case.variants` have to agree.

    A paired criterion compares the model's answer across two runs of the same
    seed. Declaring one without variants asks for a comparison with nothing to
    compare against; declaring variants without one runs the model twice and
    then ignores the second answer. Both are silent no-ops at run time, which
    is why they are errors here.

    Imported inside the function: the criteria package imports this module, so
    the registry is only populated once this one has finished loading.
