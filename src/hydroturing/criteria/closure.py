"""Conservation closure, and the fidelity check that protects its denominator.

The 5 percent engineering rule is the accept threshold: if the budget closes
to better than 5 percent of the driving flux, it counts as closed. Two notes
that belong in the methods section of any paper using this.

First, 5 percent is loose next to what a physics model achieves, which is
nearer 1e-6. The rule states engineering acceptability, not numerical rigour,
and the report always carries the measured residual alongside the verdict.

Second, a percentage needs a denominator that does not pass through zero.
Precipitation and channel inflow are strictly non-negative, so they work
directly. Net radiation changes sign every night, so the energy form
accumulates |Rn| and additionally applies an absolute floor.
