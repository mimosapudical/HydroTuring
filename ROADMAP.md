# Probes we want

The suite is deliberately small right now. This is the list of probes we want
next, so you can **claim one instead of inventing one**.

To claim: open a [probe proposal](../../issues/new?template=probe_proposal.yml)
naming the id below. We label it `accepted`, assign it to you, and it is
yours — nobody else will build it while your name is on it. Then fork the
repository and:

```bash
ht init-probe --list-templates           # the shapes available
ht init-probe --template <kind>          # get a template
ht init-probe --from probe-draft.yaml    # scaffold the directory
```

Each entry below names the template to start from. A templated probe scaffolds
into something that already passes `ht gate` against a placeholder case, so
you can watch it separate the reference models before you write any physics.

Contributors of merged probes are authors on the benchmark paper, as are
contributors of five accepted model proposals. Models are solicited too, and
this page does not list them: propose any model you think the benchmark
should have a verdict on, at
[model proposal](../../issues/new?template=model_submission.yml). You do not
need to be able to package it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#credit).

Difficulty is about the physics and the discriminating case, not the code.
Every probe here is a few hundred lines at most.

## Cross-budget consistency

A model can close its water budget and close its energy budget while being
incoherent between them. Three probes now notice: one asks whether the two
ledgers agree on a number, one whether they agree under a change neither has
seen, and one whether the energy budget paid for the ice the water budget
says melted.

### `energy/latent-heat-et-consistency` &middot; **merged**
Latent heat must equal evapotranspiration times the latent heat of the phase
change it underwent, at every step, with a temperature-dependent &lambda;.
Filed under `energy` because the schema admits mass, energy and momentum.
Contributed by Changming Li (SCUT).

### `energy/evaporative-partition` &middot; **merged**
One summer without rain under net radiation held fixed: the latent heat a
drying surface gives up has nowhere to go but the sensible and ground fluxes,
and the three changes must sum to zero. A counterfactual rather than a
same-instant residual, so a model cannot fit its way past it.
Contributed by Changming Li (SCUT).

### `energy/snowmelt-energy-water` &middot; **merged**
A pack built over a cold winter and then melted down over a dry block that opens
below -14 &deg;C and warms through zero. The surface energy residual must equal
what the pack absorbed, which is two terms: the latent heat of fusion for the
ice that changed phase, and the cold content of warming the pack towards zero.
The ice is `snw - lwsnl` rather than `snw`, because `snw` is total pack water
in this suite's own adapters and a fall in it is water leaving rather than a
phase change. The block carries no precipitation, so ice arriving cannot be
mistaken for ice melting through a contract that has no snowfall flux. Catches
a degree-day melt head bolted to an energy head that closes by itself, and
separately a pack that warms for nothing. Filed under `energy` because the
schema admits mass, energy and momentum.

## Mass

### `mass/catchment-closure` &middot; **merged**
The reference implementation. Read it before writing your own.

### `mass/resolution-invariance` &middot; **merged**
The same month at the minute, the hour and the day: do the volumes agree?

### `mass/warming-response` &middot; **merged**
Same rain, air 3 °C warmer and cooler: does runoff move the right way, both ways?

### `mass/causality` &middot; **merged**
One storm added: nothing may change before it, something must after.

### `mass/dry-down` &middot; **merged**
Two years without rain: runoff can only fall, and only stored water can drain.

### `mass/spinup-cycle-invariance` &middot; **merged**
A repeated annual forcing cycle should produce the same evaluation-year response after different amounts of prior spin-up. The three variants share one calendar evaluation year while using coprime history offsets, separating slow physical stores from persistent hidden clocks.
Contributed by Kaihao Long.

### `mass/steady-state` &middot; **merged**
Three years of the same day: everything settles and the budget balances.

### `mass/extreme-rain` &middot; **merged**
The largest storm scaled to ten times: runoff cannot fall, nor exceed the rain added.

### `mass/runoff-bounds` &middot; **merged**
Over ten years, is the runoff possible at all? The mass question a runoff-only model has to answer.

### `mass/area-invariance` &middot; **merged**
The same weather on a ten times larger catchment: every depth identical.

### `mass/response-nonnegativity` &middot; **merged**
An added storm may never lower the flow, on any day.

### `mass/antecedent-monotonicity` &middot; **merged**
The same storm after a dry month and a wet one: more runoff from the wet one, and no more than the extra water.

### `mass/phase-counterfactual` &middot; **merged**
The same water as rain instead of snow: timing moves, volumes do not.

### `mass/snowpack-mass-closure` &middot; **merged**
Closes the internal snowpack water balance separately across accumulation,
storage and melt, using precipitation, snow-module liquid outflow,
sublimation and snow-water storage. Catches snowpack-internal leakage that
can remain hidden in a whole-catchment water balance.
Contributed by Jinlong Hu (BNU).

### `mass/multi-decadal-drift` &middot; **merged**
Fifty years of repeated warm weather expose a runoff reporting deficit hidden
in accumulating storage: the budget closes, but physical capacity or repeated
block total-storage drift exposes it. Checks all reported stores without
inventing a finite groundwater capacity.
Contributed by Bing Li (@hiter-joe).

### `mass/routing-network-closure` &middot; standard &middot; **unclaimed**
A branching network. Mass must close reach by reach, not only basin-wide.
*Discriminates:* models that conserve globally while moving water between
reaches non-physically.

### `mass/human-abstraction` &middot; **merged**
A prescribed net irrigation withdrawal must leave the budget: the same weather
run with and without it, and the difference between the two runs must account
for exactly the abstracted volume (net of return flow).
*Discriminates:* models that treat abstraction as an unaccounted sink.

Contributed by Yuanhang Liu.

### `mass/exchange-response` &middot; **merged**
A declared head-driven exchange must respond to its external head. Once a
model closes its budget with `gwex`, that flux is identically minus the
residual of everything else it reported, so neither its magnitude nor its
timing on its own can separate an honest exchange from an invented one. The
probe prescribes an external head as a forcing column and runs the same
weather with the head as given, raised and lowered from the first scored step:
a model that declares it consumes the head must answer with more inflow when
it is raised and less when it is lowered, by at least a small share of its own
gross exchange — a share a head-driven boundary of any conductance clears.
Reversal frequency is reported and never gated. Authored by Songkun Yan.
*Discriminates:* models that declare the prescribed head and use the
declared-exchange channel as a sink for the day's accounting error, with or
without a token head term on top.

### `mass/gw-sw-exchange-consistency` &middot; **merged**
A model reporting groundwater-river exchange must agree with itself: the two
signed directional components (`gw_to_sw`, `sw_to_gw`) must sum to the
reported net exchange, and recharge plus that net exchange must equal the
change in aquifer storage. Groundwater-only, over a two-year daily case
driven by seeded recharge and river stage.
*Discriminates:* internally inconsistent exchange reporting through
`reference_exchange_sign_error`, which closes its own groundwater balance
exactly yet reports one directional component with the wrong sign.
Contributed by Yaji Wang (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign).

## Generalisation

Conservation that holds only where a model was fitted is not conservation, it
is a coincidence of the training distribution. These probes ask whether
the property survives a move — to another place, to another time, to a
different question. Some use an existing criterion template; others, such as
the spin-up probe, add a criterion because the case exposes a distinct failure.

### `mass/extreme-event-closure` &middot; **merged**
Overlap rainfall events in one median-wet year of a twenty-year record toward
100-year depths from synthetic 1-, 3- and 7-day DDF fits. Check every complete
precipitation event's water budget, including ordinary events, with a 5%
relative tolerance and a 0.001 mm numerical floor.
*Discriminates:* event-scale losses in `reference_in_sample` that pass
whole-record closure. The fitted thresholds describe the synthetic climate,
not the submitted model's unknown training range.
Contributed by Taiqi Lian.

### `mass/ungauged-basin-closure` &middot; **merged**
Full-window water budgets on one independently generated catchment per seed,
with soil/canopy capacities sampled across an experimental reference domain.
Uses native catchment-closure criteria, one exact reference and three physical references; annual
residuals are separate diagnostics. Catches attribute-dependent budget,
capacity, forcing and partition errors.
Contributed by Shunan Zhou (Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China).

### `mass/precipitation-counterfactual` &middot; **merged**
The same seed 20% wetter, 10% wetter and 20% drier: the water added or
removed must be partitioned among evaporation, runoff and storage, no term
may ignore or absorb it, and runoff must rise from drier to wetter. Catches
closure by construction: `reference_cheater` closes exactly on every seed,
yet its evaporation does not respond to added rain.
Contributed by Qingyi Yang (Politecnico di Milano).

### `mass/time-origin-invariance` &middot; **merged**
By Siavash Shams. The same weather under a 28-year calendar shift that
preserves seasons and leap days: evaporation, runoff and water stores agree
to a relative tolerance of 1e-9. The control budget must close and its runoff
and evaporation must respond to the forcing.

*Discriminates:* calendar-year dependence through `reference_calendar`, whose
recession changes with the year even while its water budget closes. See the
[probe](probes/mass/time-origin-invariance) for the fixed calendar window and
the normalization used to compare outputs.

## Energy

### `energy/pet-consistency` &middot; **merged**
Evaporation follows demand when the model's own soil is wettest and water when it is driest; no energy flux needed.

### `energy/surface-energy-closure` &middot; **merged**
Hourly net radiation minus sensible, latent and ground heat flux must close
within each contiguous day or night, without errors cancelling across hours
or phases. The mean absolute residual is bounded by the larger of 5 percent
of mean absolute net radiation and 2 W/m2. The boundary is a snow-free bare
surface with negligible heat capacity; ground heat flux is measured at that
surface, so no separate soil-storage term is subtracted.
Contributed by Han Wang ([@cehw](https://github.com/cehw)).

### `energy/soil-heat-storage-consistency` &middot; **merged**
Heat entering a fixed soil layer minus heat leaving its base must agree
with the layer temperature change times its prescribed heat capacity.
Heating and recovery are scored separately, so a closed surface budget
cannot hide a frozen or half-amplitude soil temperature.
Contributed by Han Wang ([@cehw](https://github.com/cehw)).

### `energy/snowpack-cold-content` &middot; hard &middot; **unclaimed**
The full snowpack energy budget including cold content and phase change. Melt
must not occur while the pack is below freezing.
*Discriminates:* models that melt snow on a warm day regardless of whether
the pack has the energy to melt.

### `energy/radiation-consistency` &middot; **merged**
The surface temperature a model reports and the upward longwave it reports
must describe one gray surface at the emissivity it was given, hour by hour:
`rlus = eps sigma ts^4 + (1 - eps) rlds` within 0.5 percent of the reported
flux, with a 0.5 W/m2 floor. A same-instant identity, so nothing cancels
across hours; net radiation stays a prescribed forcing.
*Discriminates:* a model whose temperature and radiation heads never have to
agree, through `reference_air_emitter`, which emits at the air temperature,
and `reference_no_reflection`, which drops the reflected sky.
Contributed by Xin Lan (Michigan State University).

## Momentum

### `momentum/routing-conservation` &middot; **merged**
The channel store is never negative and never holds more than its hydrograph can.

### `momentum/routing-lag-consistency` &middot; **merged**
Four synthetic catchments receive the same isolated one-day storm. Their
areas and Hack-derived channel lengths define duration-corrected Snyder lag
scales. Each runoff peak must fall inside a factor-of-two Snyder envelope with
a half-day daily-resolution allowance; adjacent lags may not reverse by more
than half a day, and the smallest-to-largest lag span must reach two days.
`reference_snyder_router` passes with a conservative triangular unit
hydrograph, `reference_instant_router` fails the lag bounds, and
`reference_inverse_router` fails the scaling criterion. A model must declare
that it consumes precipitation, area and both channel-length fields; otherwise
the result is N/A (INCOMPATIBLE), not pass or fail.

Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China; GitHub: binbinlan; ORCID:
https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9091-3185).

### `momentum/channel-routing-mass` &middot; starter &middot; **unclaimed**
Inflow minus outflow minus the change in channel storage, per reach.
Attempted for issue #71 and left unclaimed, with the reason recorded here: the
contract has no variable for water arriving at the reach, and `dis` is `mrro`
times area, so both sides of that residual would be built from the model's own
reported runoff and its own reported store. The residual would compare a model
with itself and pass by construction, whatever the model did. What was merged
instead is the one-sided statement of the same physics, in
`momentum/routing-conservation`, whose bound needs no inflow term. The entry
stays open for the day a contract carries inflow.

A route a later probe could take, from the second review of that pull request:
`closure` accepts `denominator: sum_inflow`, which reads a forcing column
`q_in`, and since #39 a probe can require models to declare that they consume it
through `requires.forcing`. For a reach-only control volume that forms
`[sum(q_in) - sum(mrro) - d(channel)] / sum(q_in)`, which on a reach-only router
is complementary to the bound: destroying the last tenth fails it and passes the
bound, holding the water back does the reverse. It carries conditions that have
to be written down with it — `closure` sums every reported store, so a
full-catchment model needs the control volume set up explicitly; the denominator
is zero on a truly inflow-free window, which `closure` reports as degenerate, so
this is a prescribed-inflow test rather than the recession test #71 proposed; no
generator produces `q_in` and no manifest declares it, so every model is N/A
today; and an adapter that reports `channel` as cumulative inflow minus outflow
closes by construction.

### `momentum/stage-discharge-monotonic` &middot; **merged**
Steady-flow rating must be monotonic. Where a loop rating appears, it must be
traversed in the physically correct direction, with the rising limb carrying
more discharge at a given stage than the falling limb.
*Discriminates:* models that fit a hydrograph while implying an impossible
relationship between depth and flow.
Contributed by Yuanhang Liu.

### `momentum/uniform-flow-friction-consistency` &middot; **merged**
Across low, medium and high constant-flow plateaus, each final steady block
must make Manning friction slope agree with the declared bed slope when
discharge, stage, explicit rectangular geometry and roughness are read
together. The mean absolute normalized residual may not exceed 5%.
*Discriminates:* smooth, monotone and even subcritical ratings built with a
different slope or Manning roughness from the geometry the model declares it
consumes. A finite-volume Saint-Venant reference supplies the independent
momentum solve.
Contributed by Mofan Zhang (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering,
Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; GitHub: Mofan-coding; ORCID:
https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8839-1808).

### `momentum/wave-celerity-bounds` &middot; **merged**
Across low, medium and high hydraulic states, paired short and long reaches
must imply downstream transient celerity within 5% of the declared
Manning/kinematic dQ/dA expectation, and the resolved celerity must increase
with flow.
*Discriminates:* fixed-celerity routers that can remain causal and
length-dependent while ignoring hydraulic state, and routers whose transient
speed is inconsistent with the reach geometry.
Contributed by Jingzhi Chen (Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA; GitHub:
mimosapudical).

### `momentum/froude-regime` &middot; standard &middot; **unclaimed**
Flow in a mild-sloped reach must stay subcritical.
*Discriminates:* spurious supercritical flow, which usually signals the model
is not solving anything resembling momentum.

## Beyond conservation

Counterfactual response and invariance have moved up into
[Generalisation](#generalisation): the harness runs paired cases now, and both
have templates. What remains out of scope for suite 0.1, listed so nobody
builds it twice:

- **Real-data track.** Internal closure under observed forcing. Note this
  tests something different from the synthetic track: observed budgets do not
  close, so observations can never be the reference.
- **Spatial permutation.** Reorder the reaches of a network, or the years of a
  record, and require the long-run totals to be unchanged. Weaker than it
  looks, because storage carries across the boundary: only the totals are
  invariant, not the series. Worth doing once the routing probes exist.
- **Cross-model agreement.** Not a conservation test at all, and a different
  kind of claim. Noted here only so it is clear it is deliberately absent.

## Adding something not on this list

Welcome, and please propose it first. The proposal form asks one question
that matters more than the rest: *how would a model pass your probe while
understanding no physics?* If you can answer that, you have a probe. If you
cannot, you may have a diagnostic rather than a test.

## Models we want

All of them, and this list deliberately does not exist. There is no roadmap
for models because there is no shortlist: any published rainfall-runoff
model, any LSTM, any foundation model making a hydrologic claim is in scope,
and the useful judgement is which ones the field would learn something from.
Open a [model proposal](../../issues/new?template=model_submission.yml) and
say why. The form's *packaging status* field decides whether the work lands
with you or with the maintainer; it does not affect your credit either way.
