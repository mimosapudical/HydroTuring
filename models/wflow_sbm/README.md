# wflow_sbm under HydroTuring

The SBM land-hydrology model of Deltares' [Wflow.jl](https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl),
at the v1.0.4 release (commit `82df720`), requested by Yuanhang Liu (Independent Researcher) in
[Flood-Lab/HydroTuring#29](https://github.com/Flood-Lab/HydroTuring/issues/29).
The model paper (van Verseveld et al. 2024, *GMD*,
[10.5194/gmd-17-3199-2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3199-2024)) evaluates v0.7.3;
this is v1.0.4, as the request asked, and the TOML format and the model code have both
changed since.

wflow_sbm couples the SBM soil column (an unsaturated store over soil layers above a
saturated store with a pseudo water table) to Gash or Rutter interception, HBV snow, and
kinematic waves for lateral subsurface, overland and river flow. It is the first physical,
distributed model submitted, and the first adapter written in Julia rather than Python.

## The catchment Wflow is given

Wflow is distributed: a TOML configuration, a netCDF of static maps and a netCDF of
forcing. The adapter gives a lumped catchment to Wflow as one representative cell and runs
it through Wflow's own time loop (`Wflow.Model`, `Wflow.run_timestep!`), reading the
model's variables after every step.

- **One representative cell at the resolution of Wflow's Moselle model.** Hillslope length
  has no lumped definition, so it comes from the model Deltares ships to test Wflow, as
  every other parameter the catchment does not name does. The cell is the square with the
  mean cell area of that schematisation as Wflow computes it: a 0.00833° grid, cell lengths
  through Wflow's `lattometres`, 607 × 927 m on average, 562 446 m² and a side of
  749.96 m. Every flux and store is a depth over the cell, so **the catchment's area
  enters only `dis`**.
- The cell sits in a 2 × 2 grid in metres (`cell_length_in_meter__flag`) with the other three
  cells inactive. Wflow reads the cell size from the coordinate spacing and drops dimensions
  of length one, so one active cell needs a second coordinate on each axis.
- The cell is **land, river and outlet** at once: local drain direction 5 (a pit), river
  mask 1. Wflow gives a pit its diagonal as flow length, 1060.6 m, and the matching flow
  width, so the land and subsurface kinematic waves drain a hillslope of that length.
- **The river** runs the same length and is 6.27 m wide, which makes it cover 1.183 % of the
  cell, the share the Moselle model's rivers cover of its catchment: river length × width
  summed over its 5 809 river cells (333.1 km²), over its 28 158 km² of active cells. Its
  median river width, 30 m, would make the river 5.7 % of a cell this size.
- The outlet has no cell downstream of it, so Wflow passes the overland and lateral
  subsurface flow that leave the outlet cell out of the map, not into the river. **`mrro` is
  everything that leaves the cell**: river discharge at the outlet plus the overland and
  subsurface outflow of the outlet cell. On the closure probe's first seed that is 80.5 %
  overland flow, 17.4 % lateral subsurface flow and 2.0 % river.

**Why not one cell with the catchment's area.** Adapter version `1.0.4-ht.1` did that. A
250 km² catchment became one 15.8 km cell draining a 22 km hillslope, and the tenfold area
of `mass/area-invariance` a 71 km one. Wflow computes lateral flow per unit length, so the
runoff depth followed the area it was told, and the overland wave held water for months at
low flow. Two of that version's four violations (area-invariance, routing-conservation) were
that geometry and pass with this one. It stays in the sensitivity tables below as the "ht.1
geometry" row.

## Parameters

What the catchment names is used; nothing is derived from the forcing.

| Wflow parameter | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| soil thickness | `soil_capacity_mm` / (θs − θr) | Wflow defines the soil water capacity as thickness × (θs − θr) (`soil.jl`), so the column holds exactly `soil_capacity_mm` |
| maximum canopy storage `Cmax` | `canopy_capacity_mm` | static.json |
| snowfall threshold `TT`, melt threshold `TTM` | `snow_threshold_degC` | static.json |
| degree-day factor `Cfmax` | `degree_day_factor_mm_per_C_day` | static.json |
| cell side; flow length | 749.96 m; 1060.6 m | Moselle: the square with its mean cell area; the pit cell's diagonal |
| river width; length | 6.27 m; 1060.6 m | Moselle river-area share of the cell, 1.183 %; the pit cell's flow length |
| θs, θr | 0.435808, 0.165628 | Moselle test model, median |
| `KsatVer`, `f` | 256.983 mm/day, 0.00335494 /mm | Moselle, median |
| Brooks–Corey `c` per layer | 9.38966, 9.70355, 10.0999, 10.0956 | Moselle, median per layer |
| soil layers | 100, 300, 800 mm and the rest | Wflow default |
| rooting depth | 387 mm | Moselle, median (Wflow caps it at 0.99 × thickness) |
| `KsatHorFrac` | 100 | Moselle, median |
| land slope, Manning n | 0.0741422, 0.4768 | Moselle, median |
| canopy gap fraction | 0.305933 | Moselle: median over cells of Wflow's exp(−Kext × LAI) at each cell's annual-mean LAI, held constant |
| Gash `EoverR` | 0.11 | Moselle, median |
| `TTI`, `WHC` | 2.0 °C, 0.1 | Moselle, median |
| `PathFrac`, `InfiltCapPath`, `rootdistpar`, `cf_soil` | 0, 5 mm/day, −500, 0.038 | Moselle, median |
| `MaxLeakage` | 0 | Moselle, median |
| river slope, Manning n, bankfull depth | 0.0017048, 0.03, 1 m | Moselle, median over river cells |
| Feddes heads, air-entry pressure, capillary rise | −100 … −16000 cm, −10 cm, 2000 mm | Wflow defaults |

"Moselle" is the schematisation Deltares ships to test Wflow (`staticmaps-moselle.nc`,
wflow-artifacts v1.0.0): medians over its 50 063 active cells, or its 5 809 river cells.
`baseflow_coefficient` and `latitude_deg` have no counterpart and are unused (the probe gives
potential evaporation, so latitude plays no part).

**What `run.json` records.** Every value the adapter sets or relies on is read back from the
model Wflow built and written to `run.json`:
- `notes.wflow_model_options`: the model options as Wflow resolved them, defaults included,
  among them the soil layers `[100, 300, 800]`, the kinematic-wave sub-steps and the
  conductivity profile;
- `notes.wflow_parameters`: every soil, vegetation, interception, snow, routing and domain
  parameter of the cell, among them the Feddes heads, the air-entry pressure, the
  capillary-rise parameters and the rooting depth after Wflow's cap, in the units Wflow holds
  them for the case's step;
- `notes.parameters.static_maps_written`: the static-map values as the adapter wrote them;
- `notes.human_withdrawal`: whether the case prescribed a withdrawal and, if it did, what it asked
  for (as given, and with any negative values set aside and counted in `ignored_negative_mm`),
  what the allocation recorded from the river and the saturated store, the return flow, any
  shortfall in the allocation, and the river balance error that shows how much of the river
  share the kinematic wave did not deliver.

A few numbers are constants in Wflow's source rather than parameters, so they cannot be read
back from the model. `notes.wflow_code_constants` names them with their values and files: the
snow refreezing efficiency, the rain and snow correction factors, the stemflow share of the gap
fraction, the 23-hour interception switch, the transpiration bounds of the Feddes h3
interpolation, the unsaturated-flow iteration step, the largest water-table change per lateral
sub-step, the kinematic-wave solver's tolerance and iteration cap, its discharge floor of 1.0e-30
m3/s, and the shares of river and subsurface storage that Wflow's allocation treats as available
to a prescribed withdrawal.

**Switched off**, because the probe's catchment has none of it: reservoirs and lakes,
glaciers, paddies, irrigation and every water-demand sector except the domestic demand that carries a prescribed `abstr` (see [A prescribed withdrawal](#a-prescribed-withdrawal)), floodplains, lateral snow transport
(which at a pit would carry snow out of the map), the frozen-soil infiltration reduction,
open water outside the river (`WaterFrac` 0), and leakage out of the saturated store
(`MaxLeakage` 0, as in the test model). Leaf area index is not cyclic, so nothing in the
model follows the calendar.

## What the adapter reports

| Column | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `pr` | the forcing, echoed as given |
| `evspsbl` | Wflow's total actual evapotranspiration (`actevap`): interception, soil evaporation, transpiration, open water |
| `mrro` | river `q_av` at the outlet + overland `q_av` + lateral subsurface `ssf` out of the outlet cell, as a depth rate over the cell |
| `dis` | `mrro` over the catchment's area: `mrro × area_km2 / 86.4`, m3/s |
| `gwex` | minus the leakage out of the saturated store (zero with `MaxLeakage` 0), and minus what Wflow's water allocation takes when a probe prescribes a withdrawal (below) |
| `mrso` | the SBM soil column: unsaturated store over all layers plus the saturated store |
| `snw` | dry snow plus the liquid water held in the pack |
| `canopy` | canopy storage |
| `channel` | water in the land and river kinematic waves, as a depth over the cell |

**`gw` is not reported.** The `sbm` model type has no store below the soil column, so there is
nothing to report; `run.json` records that under `notes.not_reported`.

**Why the saturated store is `mrso` and not `gw`.** SBM's saturated zone is the lower part of
the same soil column, below a pseudo water table `zi`, bounded by the same thickness and
porosity; the unsaturated and saturated stores together can never hold more than
thickness × (θs − θr), which is the capacity `soil_capacity_mm` names and the state bound the
probes apply to `mrso`. The contract's `gw` is groundwater *below* the soil column, and the
`sbm` type has none (Wflow's `sbm_gwf` type adds an aquifer there). Reporting the saturated
store as `gw` would count the soil capacity twice in the dry-down and runoff bounds, which
add the initial `gw` to the capacity.

## A prescribed withdrawal

`mass/human-abstraction` puts a net withdrawal in the forcing as an `abstr` column, in mm/day.
The adapter hands it to Wflow's own water demand and allocation (`demand/water_demand.jl` in
v1.0.4) and does not subtract anything from the outputs itself.

- **Demand.** Wflow's domestic sector is switched on (`model.water_demand.domestic__flag`). Its
  gross and net demand are both set to `abstr` from the forcing each step, as a depth per step.
  With gross equal to net, Wflow's return-flow fraction is zero, so all the water allocated is
  consumed.
- **Inputs and units, checked.** Wflow reads `[input.forcing]` entries into the model at every
  step, not only `[input.cyclic]` ones:
  - `run_timestep!` calls `load_dynamic_input!` (`Wflow.jl:289`);
  - that calls `update_forcing!` every step, and `update_cyclic!` only for cyclic tables
    (`io.jl:180-184`);
  - the forcing entries come from `config.input.forcing` (`io.jl:562`), and each is written straight
    into the model field its standard name points to (`io.jl:128`, `158-159`).

  The domestic demand names have unit `mm dt-1` (`standard_name.jl:258-261`), so the adapter passes
  `abstr` as a depth per step. The `dt / BASETIMESTEP` in `NonIrrigationDemand`
  (`demand/water_demand.jl:59,68`) scales only what `ncread` returns when the model is built, and
  for a forcing entry that is the default of 0.

  An hourly case confirms both: 72 hourly steps of the `mass/resolution-invariance` case with
  `abstr` at 2.4 mm/day, so 7.2 mm prescribed.
  - The allocation recorded 7.2 mm: 0.17 from the river, 7.03 from the saturated store.
  - Σ(−`gwex` × dt) is 7.200000 mm.
  - Against the same 72 hours without the column, evaporation, runoff and storage together fall
    by 7.199 mm.

  Read as mm/day and scaled again, the prescription would have come to 0.3 mm.
- **Sources.** On the one-cell domain Wflow draws from two sources, in this order:
  1. the river of the cell, up to 0.80 of the river's storage at the start of the step, taken out
     of the river kinematic wave as abstraction;
  2. the saturated store, up to 0.75 of the lateral subsurface storage, taken as negative
     recharge before the lateral subsurface kinematic wave, and so out of `mrso`.

  Wflow's defaults set the order and the areas: the Moselle model has no map for either, so
  demand goes to surface water first, in a single allocation area. There are no reservoirs, and
  the `sbm` type has no aquifer below the soil column.
- **Shortfall.** Each source gives no more than it holds, and whatever the two cannot supply is
  not allocated. `run.json` records this allocation shortfall under `notes.human_withdrawal`, with
  the number of steps it occurred on and the largest single step. Water allocated from the river
  that the river kinematic wave does not deliver is not a shortfall in the allocation; it shows
  in the river balance error instead.
- **`gwex`.** What the allocation took from the river and the saturated store in each step is
  declared as negative `gwex`, together with the leakage (zero here).
- **What it took on the gate seeds.** Nothing fell short in the allocation. Each record,
  including its spin-up year, prescribes 418 mm. The allocation recorded 4.7 to 5.6 mm from the
  river and the rest, 412 to 413 mm, from the saturated store. The saturated store's share
  leaves cleanly: Wflow's subsurface balance closes to 9e-11 m3. The river's share is not all
  delivered. The river kinematic wave takes it as a negative lateral inflow, and while its
  discharge sits at the 1.0e-30 m3/s floor (`routing/routing_process.jl`) it cannot. Wflow's
  river balance error (`human_withdrawal.river_balance_error_mm`), and with it the adapter's
  residual, comes out 3.4 to 4.3 mm larger than in the natural run, so the river lost only about
  1.2 to 1.5 mm. `gwex` still declares what the allocation recorded
  (`allocated_surface_water_mm` plus `allocated_groundwater_mm`); the undelivered water is the
  residual that `mass/human-abstraction` reports.
- **Other probes.** Water demand is switched on only when the forcing has an `abstr` column. Both
  variants of `mass/human-abstraction` carry one (all zeros in `natural`), so the pair runs one
  configuration. Switching demand on changes nothing by itself. This was checked against the build
  of `1.0.4-ht.3` from just before the wiring, which writes the same columns as this version (no
  `gw`). On the same staged cases of `mass/catchment-closure` and of `mass/dry-down` (seed
  1200831778), that build's `result.csv` and this version's are byte for byte the same, both
  with an all-zero `abstr` column added and without the column. Against `1.0.4-ht.2`, whose
  tables still had a `gw` column of zeros, only archive verdicts and details were compared (see
  Sensitivity).

## The step

Wflow takes the step as `timestepsecs` and rescales its per-day parameters itself, so rows go
in at the case's step as depths and fluxes come back as rates; the manifest lists PT1D and
PT1H. Wflow labels forcing at the end of its interval, so a row stamped with the start of an
interval is written at start + step. Two things change with the step inside Wflow itself:

- **Interception** is Gash at steps of 23 hours or more and the modified Rutter model below
  that (`sbm.jl`). Gash evaporates the day's interception within the day and carries no
  canopy store, so `canopy` is identically zero at the daily step; Rutter carries it.
- The kinematic waves sub-step at a fixed 3600 s (land) and 900 s (river) whatever the model
  step, while the lateral subsurface wave is solved once per model step.

## Packaging

Both stages of the Dockerfile use `julia:1.12.6` pinned by the digest of its multi-architecture
index (`sha256:3688355d…4a2489`), the Julia version Wflow's committed Manifest was resolved
with. Wflow is fetched at the pinned commit and installed with exactly the versions of Wflow's
own `Manifest.toml` at that commit, plus JSON 1.8.0, Parsers 3.0.0 and StructUtils 2.8.5 for the
adapter; the committed `Manifest.toml` here records that set. The adapter is a small package
(`src/WflowSbmAdapter.jl`) with a PrecompileTools workload that runs a daily and an hourly
synthetic case at build time, so the Wflow code a case needs is compiled into the image:
without it a container spent 25 to 30 seconds compiling before its first step. The image's
depot, `/opt/julia-depot`, is read-only at run time and compiled for a generic CPU of the
architecture.

Apart from `/io/output`, the only writable place in the container is `/tmp`, a 64 MB tmpfs the
harness mounts. Two things can write there:
- **Julia.** Its first depot is `/tmp/julia-depot`
  (`JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/tmp/julia-depot:/opt/julia-depot`). Julia would put compiled code or logs
  there if the caches built into the image did not match. They do, and under the harness's
  isolation Julia writes nothing there.
- **The adapter.** It writes its scratch schematisation (static maps, forcing and TOML, under a
  megabyte for a ten-year daily case) to a temporary directory on `/tmp`.

The adapter removes that directory after the run, so `/tmp` is empty when the container exits.

Built on aarch64 (Docker Desktop, Apple silicon); image 2.05 GB. One ten-year daily case takes
4.9 s in the container (3.4 s inside Julia, peak RSS 548 MB), a forty-day hourly case 2.1 s.

## Result

**FAIL (VIOLATION), 18 of 21 probes passed**, adapter `1.0.4-ht.4`, on the gate seeds, every

The five energy probes that need an energy output are N/A (INCOMPLETE) because wflow_sbm
computes no latent, sensible or ground heat flux and no surface temperature; that is the
model declining to be asked, not a failure.

`mass/human-abstraction` passes because the adapter now takes the prescribed withdrawal through
Wflow's own water demand and allocation (see [A prescribed withdrawal](#a-prescribed-withdrawal)).
At `1.0.4-ht.2` it did not read `abstr` and failed by the whole 380 mm. The 3.1 to 4.1 mm that
remain over the scored window match the water the river kinematic wave puts back from the
river's share of the withdrawal (3.4 to 4.3 mm over the whole record).

**What the geometry change moved**, from `1.0.4-ht.1` (one cell with the catchment's area) to
`1.0.4-ht.2` (this representative cell), on the same gate seeds:

| Probe | ht.1 | ht.2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mass/area-invariance` | VIOLATION: `mrro` departs by 9.2 to 13.9 relative | PASS: identical |
| `momentum/routing-conservation` | VIOLATION: 3.5 to 4.9 times the bound | PASS: 0.09 to 0.17 of it |
| `mass/dry-down` | VIOLATION on seed 1200831778: runoff too steady (cv 0.090) | VIOLATION on the same seed: runoff rises 3.6 % |
| `mass/antecedent-monotonicity` | VIOLATION on two seeds | VIOLATION on the same two seeds |
| `mass/catchment-closure` | PASS, residual 3e-6 of the rain | PASS, residual 2e-4 of the rain |

Everything else passes in both.

**The budget.** Wflow's own land, overland and subsurface mass balances close to 2e-13 mm,
3e-16 m3/s and 9e-11 m3 per step. The adapter's budget over the reported stores closes to
1.8e-4 to 2.1e-4 of the rain on the closure probe and 2.7e-4 to 3.2e-4 on the time-origin
control, and all of that is the river kinematic wave. Wflow's river balance error summed over
the record (`wflow_river_balance_error_cumulative_mm` in `run.json`) equals the adapter's residual.
Its lateral inflow is rain on the river
surface minus open-water evaporation from it, which is negative on 2 877 of the 4 015 days of
the closure probe's first seed; the wave floors its discharge at 1e-30 m3/s rather than drying
the channel, and the water that creates, 1.71 mm over the record, is exactly the adapter's
residual. On days with non-negative inflow the error is below 2e-17 m3/s. It is larger than in
ht.1 (3e-6) because the river covers 1.18 % of a 750 m cell rather than 0.27 % of a 15.8 km one,
and it stays more than two orders of magnitude inside the 5 % limit. A probe that scores one wet day
on its own can see it, though: `mass/extreme-event-closure` allows max(5 % of an event's rain,
0.001 mm), and on seed 2013358868 a 0.006 mm drizzle day carries 0.0016 mm of it and fails. On all
five of that probe's seeds the adapter's residual summed over the record equals
`wflow_river_balance_error_cumulative_mm` to 1e-4 mm, and every day on which it exceeds 0.001 mm
is water created, never lost.

**Steps.** Between PT1D and PT1H the volumes move by 0.4 to 1.1 % of the rain (runoff 0.7 %,
end-of-record soil storage 1.1 % on the worst seed) although interception changes scheme with
the step: Wflow puts its per-day parameters in the units of the step itself, and its kinematic
waves sub-step at the same fixed lengths at both.

### The two violations

Each was diagnosed with the adapter's own `simulate()`, a per-step trace of the soil column and
the harness's own criteria on every gate seed. Neither depends on the cell geometry. Both move
with the mapping of the stated soil capacity onto Wflow's soil thickness and the Moselle
rooting depth, which the sensitivity tables below vary, so both are statements about SBM under
that mapping rather than about SBM alone.

**`mass/antecedent-monotonicity`.** The generator puts a 60 mm storm on 19 July. In the wet
variant 120 mm falls over the 20 days before 9 July, then both variants have ten dry days
before the storm. The criterion counts its month from the storm and takes the share against
the 60 mm itself.

On the two failing seeds, 1295520324 and, in brackets, 1802472438:
- On 18 July the wet column holds 220.5 mm against the dry column's 218.2 mm (226.8 against
  220.7): only 2.3 mm (6.1 mm) wetter. It evaporated 83 mm (82 mm) of the 120 mm while the rain
  fell and 36 mm (35 mm) more in the ten dry days, against 2 to 3 mm and 0.4 mm in the dry run.
- Both columns sit just above 215 mm, which is (soil thickness − rooting depth) × (θs − θr) =
  (1184 − 387) × 0.270. SBM transpires from the unsaturated store only in rooted layers, and
  from the saturated store only where the water table is above the rooting depth (a sigmoid
  with `rootdistpar` −500). Water below the Moselle roots is out of evaporation's reach, and
  both runs are drained down to it.
- The storm lifts both to 273 to 282 mm, far from the 320 mm at which SBM makes
  saturation-excess runoff. Over the 30 days from the storm they run off 1.70 against 1.63 mm
  (1.44 against 1.41 mm): 0.0013 (0.0005) of the storm, where the probe asks for 0.02. The
  −0.0011 and −0.0010 first reported here came from a criterion that opened its month on 9 July,
  where the wet run returns 1.57 against 1.64 mm (1.46 against 1.55 mm); #35 corrected it.

The third seed passes because its wet column arrives 57 mm wetter (276.5 against 219.1 mm),
and 17.4 and 25.3 mm more rain fall within the next nine days. That saturates it (318.8 mm) and
returns 37.5 mm more, 0.62 of the storm.

The verdict holds under every mapping tried, but whether a storm crosses the threshold depends
on where the mapping puts that evaporation floor against the stated capacity:
- With the Moselle model's own 2000 mm soil thickness and θs lowered to keep the 320 mm
  capacity, the floor rises to (2000 − 387) × 0.16 = 258 mm. The wet column on the second seed
  then reaches 319.1 mm, returns 0.038 of the storm, and that seed passes.
- With roots through 99 % of the column there is no floor. The wet column arrives 100 mm wetter
  but still far from saturation; the first seed still fails (0.0000) and the second clears the
  bound by a hair (0.020).

**`mass/dry-down`.** Two of the three seeds drain 38 and 45 mm against a 322 mm bound and
never rise. On seed 1200831778:
- The rain stops with the water table at 467 mm, below the 387 mm roots, and 56 mm in the
  unsaturated store.
- Transpiration draws on the rooted part of that store; the unsaturated store as a whole drains
  from 56 mm to 19 mm by late March. As the rooted part
  empties, transpiration falls from 0.85 to 0 mm/day in February, while potential evaporation
  rises from 0.9 to 2.3 mm/day.
- Gravity drainage from the unsaturated store into the saturated store continues (0.37 falling
  to 0.04 mm/day), so the saturated store refills from 190.0 to 192.4 mm and the water table
  rises 9 mm.
- Lateral subsurface flow follows the water table, not the total storage, and here it is all of
  the runoff. It rises 12 %, and runoff rises 3.6 % between weekly blocks 6 and 7, with 17.9 mm
  drained over the two years.

In ht.1 the same seed failed the other way: its 22 km hillslope turned the same drainage into a
trickle too steady to count as varying (cv 0.090). With the Moselle thickness the water table
starts at the roots (389 mm), and runoff rises 7.6 % by the same route. With roots through 99 %
of the column, transpiration reaches the saturated store and empties it (0.001 to 0.004 mm
drains in two years), and all three seeds pass. So this is a statement about SBM with a water
table below its roots.

### Sensitivity

On the gate seeds, through the adapter's `simulate()` with one setting each (`apply_overrides!`),
scored with the harness's criteria:

- **ht.1 geometry** is one cell with the catchment's own area, its river 30 m wide.
- **roots 0.99 × thickness** sets the rooting depth to Wflow's own cap.
- **Moselle thickness** is 2000 mm with θs lowered so the column still holds the stated
  capacity.

The land roughness and horizontal-conductivity settings tried on ht.1 moved neither remaining
violation there and were not repeated.

The rows marked ht.2 were computed before `1.0.4-ht.3`. That version drops the `gw` column, adds
to `run.json`, and takes a prescribed withdrawal through Wflow's water demand; `1.0.4-ht.4`
relabels and adds to `run.json`. Without a withdrawal neither changes an output value: on the
gate seeds, the archive rows for the nineteen probes other than `mass/human-abstraction` match
the ht.2 rows in verdict and detail. That compares archive rows, not tables, since ht.2's tables
still carry the `gw` column.

`momentum/routing-conservation`, channel over its bound (limit 1), seeds 417694852,
924646966, 1431599080:

| Setting | | | | largest channel store |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| as shipped (ht.2) | 0.17 | 0.12 | 0.09 | 20 to 24 mm |
| ht.1 geometry | 3.49 | 4.79 | 4.91 | 95 to 101 mm |
| roots 0.99 × thickness | 0.16 | 8.56 | 0.14 | 20 to 24 mm |
| Moselle thickness | 0.13 | 0.18 | 0.12 | 20 to 24 mm |

These figures are from the case as it stood before `momentum/routing-conservation`
`version: 2`, the weather change that probe took on 2026-09-17: the numbers are
the comparison between settings, made on one case. On the case the probe now
generates, the shipped setting measures **0.16 on each of the three seeds**, with
a largest store of 16 to 20 mm. The other three settings were not re-run.

The 8.56 is one step, the first scored day. Deep roots have dried the column to 68 mm, runoff
over the preceding 30 days is 0.00001 mm/day, and the channel still holds a 0.002 mm trace.

`mass/dry-down`, seeds 186927550, 693879664, 1200831778 (a weekly rise may not exceed 2 %,
runoff cv must reach 0.1):

Putting the saturated store in `mrso` moves no result: `mrso` stays inside its bound on every
closure seed. The dry-down and runoff bounds would add an initial `gw` to the capacity if one
were reported. None is, so they are held to the stated capacities, and they pass or fail here
for reasons that do not involve it.
